        Creation & Development
     </h2>

     <p id="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was 
        casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage 
        demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.
        As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system"
        what he felt was missing in comic books.In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman
        pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence,and in a multitude 
        of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a 
        wallâ€”adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become 
        unsure of whether or not this is true.
